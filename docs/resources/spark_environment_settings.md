  workspace_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  environment_id     = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
  publication_status = "Published"

  driver_cores  = 4
  driver_memory = "28g"

  executor_cores  = 4
  executor_memory = "28g"

  runtime_version = "1.2"

  dynamic_executor_allocation = {
    /*
   your settings here
   */
  }

  pool = {
    /*
   your settings here

- `driver_memory` (String) Spark driver memory. Accepted values: `28g`, `56g`, `112g`, `224g`, `400g`.
- `dynamic_executor_allocation` (Attributes) Dynamic executor allocation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dynamic_executor_allocation))
- `executor_cores` (Number) Spark executor core. Accepted values: `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`.
- `executor_memory` (String) Spark executor memory. Accepted values: `28g`, `56g`, `112g`, `224g`, `400g`.
- `pool` (Attributes) Environment pool. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--pool))
- `runtime_version` (String) [Runtime](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/runtime) version. Possible values: `1.1`, `1.2`, `1.3`.
- `spark_properties` (Map of String) A map of key/value pairs of Spark properties.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--dynamic_executor_allocation"></a>

### Nested Schema for `dynamic_executor_allocation`

Optional:

- `enabled` (Boolean) The status of the dynamic executor allocation. Accepted values: `false` - Disabled, `true` - Enabled.
- `max_executors` (Number) The maximum executor number.
- `min_executors` (Number) The minimum executor number.

<a id="nestedatt--pool"></a>

### Nested Schema for `pool`

Optional:

- `name` (String) The Pool name. `Starter Pool` means use the starting pool.
- `type` (String) The Pool type. Accepted values: `Capacity`, `Workspace`.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The Pool ID.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
